Repository content:
===

This repository contains the following code scripts:  

<!-- * `scripts/build-professions-profiles.R` -- R script that starts from `data/all_users_data.csv.xz`, and builds the profession profiles (stored in the file `data/profession-profiles.csv`); -->
<!-- * `scripts/vocation-map.R` -- R script that starts from `data/profession-profiles.csv` to build the Vocation Map starting from occupation psychological profiles; -->
<!-- * `scripts/predict-profession-python.ipynb` -- Python Jupyter notebook to build predictors for forecasting user occupation. -->
<!-- * `scripts/prediction-step1-run-prediction.sh` -- Bash script to transform the Jupyter notebook to a `py` file and run it without a graphical interface; -->
<!-- * `scripts/prediction-step2-read-prediction-models-from-Python.R` -- R script (using the `reticulate` package, which reads Python data sctructures produced by `scripts/predict-profession-python.ipynb` and builds R structures); -->
<!-- * `scripts/prediction-step3-plot-prediction.R` -- R script that plots the prediction performance indicators (Precision, Recall, F1 score and Accuracy); -->
<!-- * `scripts/construct-confusion-matrix.R` -- R script that loads the prediction results (see `data/prediction-results`) and builds the confusion matrix. -->
<!-- * `scripts/utils.R` -- additional functions for reading, writing data and plotting. -->

The following data and plots is also available:

* `data/reddit.csv.xz` -- contains the monthly counts of links towards domains in Reddit (CSV compressed using LZMA). Lines are domain names, columns are months.
* `data/twitter.csv.1.xz` and `data/twitter.csv.2.xz` -- contain the monthly counts of links towards domains in Twitter (CSV compressed using LZMA). Lines are domain names, columns are months. The data frame has been split into two halves to respect GitHub's maximum file limits. The files need to be loaded individually, and concatenated at the level of rows. For example, in `R` do:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# note: this might take some time to run, and require quite a bit of memory
twitter.csv <- rbind(read.csv("data/twitter.csv.1.xz", sep=""),
                     read.csv("data/twitter.csv.2.xz", sep="") )
```

<!-- * `plots/vocation-map-static.pdf` -- a static version of the Vocation Map.  -->
<!-- * `plots/vocation-map-interactive.html` -- the interactive version of the Vocation Map. Also available at http://bit.ly/vocation-map-interactive . -->
<!-- * `plots/confusion-heatmap-dendogram.pdf` -- the confusion map for the XGBoost classifier (based on `data/prediction-results/*`) -->

<!-- The following files cannot be publicly shared due to the Twitter's and IBM Watson's Terms of Service. -->
<!-- However, these files could be provided privately upon request, requests are evaluated at a case-by-case basis. -->

<!-- * `data/all_users_data.csv.xz` -- contains the psychological profiles of all 128,278 users in our study; -->
<!-- * `data/10_professions_data.csv.xz` -- contains the Big5 and the personal values (10 features) for 38,073 users in the occupation prediction part of the paper; -->
<!-- * `data/10_professions_data_big5.csv.xz` -- contains solely the Big5 traits for the 38,073 users above (useful for the ablation study); -->
<!-- * `data/10_professions_data_values.csv.xz` -- contains solely the personal values for the 38,073 users above (useful for the ablation study). -->
